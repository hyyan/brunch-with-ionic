# Brunch With Ionic Sass And AngularJS

HTML5 mobile application skeleton with [Brunch](http://brunch.io), [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) And [AngularJS] (https://angularjs.org)

## Getting started
* Install (if you don't have them):
    * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): `brew install node` on OS X
    * [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `npm install -g brunch`
    * [Bower](http://bower.io): `npm install -g bower`
    * Brunch plugins and Bower dependencies: `npm install & bower install`.
* Run:
    * `brunch watch --server`  watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with [pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).
    * `brunch build --production` builds minified project for production
* Learn:
    * `www/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server.  Write your code in `app/` dir.
    * static files in `app/assets/` will be copied to `www/`.
    * Place styles in `app/styles` to be compiled to `www/css/app.css`
    * Place javascripts in `app/scripts` to be concatenated to `www/js/app.js`
